## Challenges

I have faced many challenges in developing this application. I have listed some of them here with the solution I came up with.

* One of the biggest challenges was handling state in React. I came to know there is something called 'stale state'. This gave me a lot of trouble. Like here:

  ```js
  setCards([...cards, newElement]);
  ```

  This here is what I was talking about. This is not the correct way to set the state in react app. The right way is:

  ```js
  setCards(currentCards => {
    //Some code here
    return [...currentCards, newElement];
  });
  ```
  I fixed it using this article: https://medium.com/@shanakaprince/understanding-stale-state-in-react-and-how-to-avoid-it-a74cc4655c43

* I faced a strange issue with MongoDB database. It was 'MongoError: E11000 duplicate key error ...'. I solved it using this article: https://congtuanle.medium.com/mongoerror-e11000-duplicate-key-error-collection-695e7e9ccdc4

* I also faced issues with deployment which I fixed using this article: https://dev.to/pixelrena/deploying-your-reactjs-expressjs-server-to-rendercom-4jbo

##  Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

###  Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine.

  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)

You will also need a MongoDB database. You can use a local installation or a cloud service like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

###  Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Sticky-DO.git
    cd Sticky-DO
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend Server:**

      * Navigate to the server directory:
        ```sh
        cd server
        ```
      * Install the required npm packages:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```
      * Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory. This file will store your environment variables.
        ```env
        MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        ```
      * Start the server:
        ```sh
        npm run start
        ```

    The server should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

3.  **Set up the Frontend Client:**

      * Open a new terminal and navigate to the client directory from the project's root:
        ```sh
        cd client
        ```
      * Install the required npm packages:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```
      * Start the React development server:
        ```sh
        npm run start
        ```

    The client application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` and connected to the backend.
